I'm currently a third year student at <b>Visvesvaraya National Institute of Technology (VNIT) Nagpur</b>, focusing on Mining Engineering while passionately diving into Machine Learning, AR/VR/XR technologies, and Web & Mobile Application Development. Keep an eye on this space for regular updates, and you can also check out my ongoing and completed projects [here](#).

This past winter (2022), I interned as a Mobile App Developer at Vidhyasoft, where I was part of a team that developed an educational application aimed at aiding students in remote areas of India. I also had the opportunity to work as an Android Development Intern at Liveasy Logistics, where I developed a payment interface and integrated GPS tracking features into their trucker app. Before diving into these internships, I've been actively involved in various tech projects, including creating an e-commerce auction site and a fully functional mobile web browser.

For a deeper dive into my professional journey, you can check out my CV and LinkedIn. Feel free to explore the other pages on this website for more insights into my work.
